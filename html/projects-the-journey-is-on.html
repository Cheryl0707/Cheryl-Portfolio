                        Over a patch of grass, a lovely lady beetle baby named Lucas rickety flew out from the bushes. He excitingly looks around the world and stretches his wings to fly. Lucas is curious about the world, the sunshine, fresh air, and vast grassland. All of them are appealing to him! Although he kept looking around, a flying dandelion caught his eyes. The dandelion was randomly blown away with the strong wings flowing, kissing like tiny white umbrellas. Lucas curiously follows the dandelion and gets far away from his safe shelter. 
Suddenly, the weather gets gloomy. There was nothing but the whirring winds and the gathering dark clouds. The rainstorm was soon to break out. However, Lucas didn’t prepared enough to face the rainstorm with frail wings. <br>
Lucas puts a desperate struggle with the strong wind, which is effortless because he lacks practice and experience. He had no way to control the direction but dangling in the air. Suddenly, he got a heavy blow from a flying branch and lost his left-wing. How long can a wet and injured wing last in a storm? Finally, he was blown into a crack on the ground, his body was blown upside down, and there was no fulcrum, no family, no hope.
After the storm stops, an ant named Peter passes by with his dinner — rice. He saw Lucas and passionately helped him to turn over his body. He tried hard to against the gravity. After a few tries, Lucas was saved. They become friends! Peter picked up his rice and the lost baby ladybird, walked home together.
